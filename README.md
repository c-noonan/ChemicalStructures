# NeurotransmitterChemicalStructures - A tool for viewing chemicals in the brain

## Background and Overview

ChemicalStructures is a interactive tool that allows the user to click on various, prelisted chemicals that exist in the brain and receive information about what the structure looks like and various facts about it.

## Functionality & MVP

Users will be able to:
- [ ] Read a short description about what the biochemical does
- [ ] View the chemical structure of it
- [ ] Click through a list of multiple chemicals(neurotransmitters) found in the brain
 
Also:
- [ ] A short about section that remains stationary to the side of the list telling the user how to interact with the tool and what to expect.
- [ ] Links to my github repo and linkedIn page
 
## Wireframes
 
The app will be relatively basic in it's setup. It will consist of a single page that has a header with the title of the project, a main section that will have two parts: one part on the left side that describes what the user can do on the site and how to navigate it, and the second part on the right hand side that contains the list of biochemicals that when clicked, will render the structure of the chosen biochemical. The bottom will have a footer containing links to both my linkedIn and github repo.

## Architecture and Technologies

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

- [ ] Vanilla JavaScript for overall logic
- [ ] HTML Canvas to render each chemical structure
- [ ] Basic CSS and HTML for style/organization

Main scripts involved in the project:

- [ ] a folder where all the .js files are kept for each neurotransmitter
- [ ] an index HTML for the page organization and to contain all the componenets of the page, including logic of switching between js scripts

## Implementation Timeline

Day 1: Setup project. Get all files necessary created with bare skeletons to be filled in when necessary. Start to manipulate Canvas to figure out how to draw each structure.

- [ ] Get Canvas working enough to know how to draw out/render each chemical structure
- [ ] Complete enough styling to render basic functionality on the page.

Day 2: Make sure all the information necesary for the project is rendered accurately. Decide how many bichemicals should be featured on the site. Finish at leaast half of the Canvas drawings, including descriptions about each neurotransmitter.

- [ ] Complete half of chemical structures.
- [ ] Style enough to have one chemical structure rendered on the page. 

Day 3: Finish rendering all information. Make sure all structures/descriptions are drawn and rendered. Style completely and make sure entire website looks good and has easy UX/UI.

- [ ] Complete remaining files necessary for project to be fully functional.
- [ ] Make sure website looks good and is layed out in a simple, consise manner.

Day 4: Complete fully, including any bonus features given enough time. Style is complete and professional; everything works how it's supposed to and is easy to navigate and use.

- [ ] Complete all styling
- [ ] Complete any remaining files necessary for the logic of the application, including JS logic for switching between scripts on index.html.
- [ ] Potentially finish any bonus features of the application

## Bonus features
 
Given time, the project could also include:
 
- [ ] The structure of various drugs used to treat a number of health disorders that results from either an excess or depletion of the various neurotransmitters.
- [ ] If the drug induces a change in chemical structure, users can see the change; if not, a description about which drug does what to the patient.
