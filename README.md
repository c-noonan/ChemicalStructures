# NeurotransmitterChemicalStructures - A tool for viewing chemicals in the brain

![LIVE](https://c-noonan.github.io/ChemicalStructures/)

## Background and Overview

ChemicalStructures is a interactive tool that allows the user to click on various, prelisted chemicals that exist in the brain and receive information about what the structure looks like and various facts about it. Users can read a short description about what the biochemical does, view the chemical structure of it, and click through a list of multiple chemicals(neurotransmitters) found in the brain

## Architecture and Technologies

This project features vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 Cavas, CSS3, and HTML.

## Implementation Timeline

Day 1: Setup project. Get all files necessary created with bare skeletons to be filled in when necessary. Start to manipulate Canvas to figure out how to draw each structure.

- [ ] Get Canvas working enough to know how to draw out/render each chemical structure
- [ ] Complete enough styling to render basic functionality on the page.

Day 2: Make sure all the information necesary for the project is rendered accurately. Decide how many bichemicals should be featured on the site. Finish at leaast half of the Canvas drawings, including descriptions about each neurotransmitter.

- [ ] Complete half of chemical structures.
- [ ] Style enough to have one chemical structure rendered on the page. 

Day 3: Finish rendering all information. Make sure all structures/descriptions are drawn and rendered. Style completely and make sure entire website looks good and has easy UX/UI.

- [ ] Complete remaining files necessary for project to be fully functional.
- [ ] Make sure website looks good and is layed out in a simple, consise manner.

Day 4: Complete fully, including any bonus features given enough time. Style is complete and professional; everything works how it's supposed to and is easy to navigate and use.

- [ ] Complete all styling
- [ ] Complete any remaining files necessary for the logic of the application, including JS logic for switching between scripts on index.html.
- [ ] Potentially finish any bonus features of the application

## Bonus features
 
Given time, the project could also include:
 
- [ ] The structure of various drugs used to treat a number of health disorders that results from either an excess or depletion of the various neurotransmitters.
- [ ] If the drug induces a change in chemical structure, users can see the change; if not, a description about which drug does what to the patient.
